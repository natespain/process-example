						<h1>Determine Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p>After the research portion of the assignment, we focused on determining the website audience as well as the appropriate goals.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>This portion of the research was about determining our target audiences. So many of us began large and broadly and then eliminated less important demographics.</p>
					<!-- The class called "row" is called so that we can use the column classes (4u, 8u, etc) in the divs inside. -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-13.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>This was the first outcome of our audience exercise. I was trying to cover all the possible people that would visit the site. My categories were those who need help, those at risk, those who visit the site to give help, and those who are competitors.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-14.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>I narrowed down my main audience so that it would be mainly people wanting to give help. This would primarily include donators, member organizations, churches, students, volunteers, universities, shelters, and the formerly homeless.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-15.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>My audience that might be visiting the site to get help were homeless people in Cincinnati or those living in the Over the Rhine. This is the place in downtown Cincinnati that is being gentrified as I mentioned earlier.</p></div>

					<h3>Goals Conclusions</h3>
					<p>As mentioned before the primary overarching goals of the GCCH is to eradicate homelessness through coordination of services, advocating policy change, and raising awareness and education of homelessness. The audience's goals are to access these services as well as to volunteer, sponsor the coalition, and donate. The website being the vehicle for these services online seeks to make education accessible, provide an outlet for coordinating services, and accrue members. I used my research of the website, the member org. website, and my audience exercise to determine these goals</p>

					<p>The specific goals and content are based on my interview with Dr. Mussman as well as the content that is currently on the GCCH website. The current GCCH website is in no short of content, if anything it has too much. The main work will be learning how to organize the information on the redesigned site so that it is clear and useful.</p>

					<p>Since I completed this assignment before my interviews, I adjusted a couple things so that the goals would portray the true goals of the coalition. I managed to assume correctly that schools, students, and churches were the coalitions top audiences. However, I had to change the content to consider that the coalition does not offer volunteering. So there still will be a volunteering tab but it will instead give info on how to work through the coalition in order to contribute. This new version of my goals also has more specified information. For example, I specified that if someone in the audience wants to sponsor then they would sponsor a shantytown or an edition of the Streetvibes paper.</p>
