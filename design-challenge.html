						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p>First, we started with determining the design challenge. This is a worksheet from the Human Centered Design Toolkit helps frame the challenge as an actionable question.</p>
					</header>
					<h3>What is the problen you're trying to solve?</h3>
						<p>How does the GCHC website contribute to the end of homelessness in Cincinnati?</p>
						<h3>Now, state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h3>
						<p>Increaesed support and donations to help eradicate homelessness in Cincinnati.</p>
						<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3>
						<p>Hierarchy, Specific Goals shown on the homepage, appeal to main audience to support and volunteer, and a more approachable design.</p>
						<h3>Finally, write down some of the content and constraints that you're facing.</h3>
						<p>Only the Cincinnati, Ohio area. small organization, and I do not live inCincinnati to directly get information from them.</p>
						<h3>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
						<p>How do I create a more specific goal, audience, and inviting homepage for the Cincinnati population to help eradicate homelessness.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>This exercise was helpful but I realized that I needed to frame the question so that it included the ways the site listed to eradicate homelessness.</p>
						<p>A better design challenge would be, <strong>"How do I create a website for GCCH that facilitates coordinating of services, educating the public, and engaging in advocacy to end homelessness in the Cincinnati area?"</strong></p>
