						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p>After collecting all of the research, we were asked to determine the primary call-to-action of the home page, as well as develop a style tile.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-27.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>I decided to make "Join the Coalition." my CTA for the Greater Cincinnati Homeless Coalition's site. I think this CTA addresses many of the reasons someone might have for coming to the site. The coalition already offers many ways for someone to participate as a member; someone may want to donate, sponsor their paper, offer advocacy, or even volunteer. This CTA is a way for any of those possible contributions to be made. I think the number one reason someone is coming to the site is that they want to help, get volunteering opportunities, or contribute to the cause. This CTA answers those needs.
						</p><p>After receiving my interview answers I realized that the site would need the secondary CTA "Donate". The director of education of the GCCH mentioned that a great portion of the site is meant to draw donations because their organization is entirely run off donations. However, he also stated the site is meant to educate, advocate, and coordinate so the primary CTA should still stand to address majority of the audiences that visit the site.

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u1"><p>We were asked to create a mood board, or style tile, that features key elements of the site design such as type, CTA buttons, and color that communicate the mood of the organization.</p></div>
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/GCHC-9.jpg" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>My style tile seeks to communicate the Greater Cincinnati Coalition as dynamic, collaborative, communal, friendly, hardworking, reliable. I chose these adjectives based on the actions of the coalition, the interview with Dr. Mussman, and my research of other coalition websites. I chose News Gothic MT, Bold for my header typeface and Serifa, Roman as my sub head. I felt that the combination of these typefaces feel bold, which is needed for an organization with goals of policy change in government, but friendly for visitors of the site.
						</p><p>
							Red is used here to keep the current branding of the Coalition but with the addition of dark blue to give the feel of an organization with advocacy for policy change as well as a collaborative feel. The CTA are pictured here as well in full color. The picture is to provide an example of the type of imagery I will post on the site that gives the coalition a communal and powerful feeling.
						</p><p>
							 I want people to feel a strong call to action to join the fight against homelessness. The icons are part of an idea of what I would feature on the home page to provide quick user paths for people who may not know how to help, or what the coalition does. The history icon is there because in my interview I learned the coalition would like a way for people to see their timeline of work on the site.
